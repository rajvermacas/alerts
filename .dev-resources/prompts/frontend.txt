Currently there is no UI. Build a UI to have button to upload the xml alert which is then sent to the orchestrator agent.
The html report which is then generated should also be seen as a result on the UI page itself.
When the UI sends the request to the orchestrator agent there should be a loading.

  Clarifying Questions

  1. Frontend Framework Choice

  What frontend framework should we use?
  - Default: Plain HTML/CSS/JS with HTMX - Minimal complexity, leverages your existing Tailwind CSS in reports

  My recommendation: Given this is a POC and you already generate Tailwind-styled HTML reports, HTMX + vanilla JS keeps it lean.
  Thoughts? - Yes sure default plan looks good

  ---
  2. Backend API Layer

  Should we create a new FastAPI service or extend the existing A2A server?
  Do not create a wrapper on orchestrator. Create a fastapi backend that will call the orchestrator api. These 2 be separates.

  ---
  3. File Upload Handling

  How should we handle the uploaded XML?
  - Default: Temporary file storage - Save to /tmp/ or configurable temp directory, process, then cleanup

  ---
  4. Report Display Strategy

  How should the HTML report be displayed in the UI?
  - Default: Embed via iframe - Your reports are self-contained with inline Tailwind CSS
  - Alternative: Extract and inject into a div (more complex, potential CSS conflicts)

  My take: Iframe is simpler and your reports already look professional. Any concerns?
  do not use iframe. Use the underlying data from the report json and create a new page on the frontend which is shown after the alert processing is completed.

  5. Loading State UX

  What loading experience do you want?
  - Default: Spinner with status messages - Show "Analyzing alert...", "Running tools...", etc.

  ---
  Questions to Consider for Quality/Experience

  1. Error Handling Display: How should we show errors to users? (e.g., invalid XML, agent timeout, LLM failure)
    - Suggestion: Toast notifications with retry option
  2. History/Session: Should users see previously analyzed alerts in the same session?
    - Default: No history - single analysis at a time (lean approach)
  3. Alert Preview: Should users see the raw XML content before submitting?
    - Suggestion: Collapsible preview panel after upload
  4. Download Options: Should users be able to download the report as standalone HTML/PDF?
    - Your JSON and HTML are already saved to resources/reports/ - just expose download links? - yes expose downloadable links
  5. Authentication: Is this internal-only or do you need auth?
    - Default for POC: No auth, local network only
=============================

 Follow-up Questions

  1. Report UI from JSON

  Since you want to render the report from JSON rather than iframe, I need to understand scope:

  How much of the existing HTML report design should the new UI replicate?
  - Option A: Full feature parity - replicate the entire current HTML report design (split-screen, all sections, SVG network graph
  for wash trade)
  - Option B: Simplified view - key findings, determination, confidence scores, reasoning narrative only
  - Default suggestion: Option A - reuse the same Tailwind structure/components but render dynamically

  Note: The wash trade report has an SVG relationship network visualization. Should we include that in the dynamic UI?

  Answer: The wash trade report doesn't use SVG relationship anymore. it uses Cytoscape.js. Yes use the Cytoscape.js graph in the dynamic UI.

  2. Orchestrator Communication

  You said FastAPI should call the Orchestrator A2A API. Currently the orchestrator runs on port 10000.

  Should the FastAPI backend assume the orchestrator is already running, or should we document the startup sequence?
  - Default: Document that user must start orchestrator servers first (insider trading: 10001, wash trade: 10002, orchestrator:
  10000)

  ---
  3. Port & Project Structure

  What port should the UI FastAPI service run on?
  - Default: 8080

  Where should the UI code live?
  - Default: src/alerts/frontend/ directory with:
  frontend/
  ├── __init__.py
  ├── app.py          # FastAPI application
  ├── static/         # CSS, JS
  └── templates/      # HTML templates (Jinja2)

  ---
  4. Alert Type Detection in UI

  The orchestrator determines alert type (insider trading vs wash trade) from the XML.

  Should the UI show different result layouts based on alert type?
  - Default: Yes - Insider Trading shows trader baseline analysis, Wash Trade shows relationship network
  - This aligns with your two different Pydantic models (InsiderTradingDecision vs WashTradeDecision)

  Final Questions Before We Proceed

  1. Confirm port 8080 for UI service? - Yes
  2. Full feature parity with existing HTML reports (including SVG network graph)? Use Cytoscape.js graphs
  3. Any additional fields you want in the UI that aren't in current reports? - no
